# SmartSpec Infographic Generation Prompt

This file contains the AI generation prompt used to create the SmartSpec 100% Workflow Loop Completeness infographic.

---

## Context

SmartSpec is an AI-native development framework that provides **100% end-to-end coverage** of the software development lifecycle through 8 critical, interconnected workflow loops. The infographic visualizes this completeness and the interconnected nature of the system.

For detailed explanations of each loop, see **[WORKFLOW_LOOPS_EXPLAINED.md](WORKFLOW_LOOPS_EXPLAINED.md)**.

## Generation Prompt

Create a professional, modern infographic titled **'SmartSpec Framework: 100% Workflow Loop Completeness'**. The design should be clean, technical, and visually striking with a dark blue and green color scheme.

### Header Section

At the top center, display a large circular progress indicator showing **'100%'** in bold white text, with a complete green circular progress bar around it. Below it, add the subtitle **'8/8 Critical Loops Complete'** in smaller text.

### Main Content Area

The main content area should show 8 distinct workflow loops arranged in a grid layout (2 rows of 4). Each loop should be represented by:

1. A green checkmark icon (✓)
2. The loop name in bold
3. A brief one-line description
4. A small circular diagram showing the loop flow with arrows

### The 8 Loops to Display

1. **Happy Path Loop** - 'Ideation → Deploy → Monitor' (9 phases)
2. **Debugging Loop** - 'Test Failure → Fix → Verify' (5 phases)
3. **Incident Response Loop** - 'Alert → Triage → Resolve' (6 phases)
4. **Continuous Improvement Loop** - 'Metrics → Feedback → Update' (6 phases)
5. **Rollback Loop** - 'Failure → Decision → Execute' (5 phases)
6. **Dependency Management Loop** - 'Scan → Analyze → Update' (6 phases)
7. **Code Quality Loop** - 'Analyze → Refactor → Verify' (6 phases)
8. **Performance Optimization Loop** - 'Profile → Optimize → Measure' (6 phases)

### Footer Section

At the bottom, add a footer section with three key statistics in rounded boxes:

- **'40+ Workflows'**
- **'Evidence-First Development'**
- **'Full SDLC Coverage'**

### Branding & Style

- Include the SmartSpec logo or text branding in the top left corner
- Use icons, arrows, and connecting lines to show the interconnected nature of the loops
- The overall style should be modern, technical, and suitable for a software development framework presentation
- Color scheme: Dark blue and green with white text for contrast
