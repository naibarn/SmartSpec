_# SmartSpec Workflow: Release Tagger

**Workflow:** `/smartspec_release_tagger`  
**Version:** 6.1.1

## 1. Overview

The Release Tagger automates the process of creating and pushing Git tags for a new release. It ensures that tags are consistent, GPG-signed (if configured), and linked to the correct commit and release notes.

## 2. Key Features

- **Automated Tagging:** Creates semantic version tags (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
- **GPG Signing:** Enforces GPG signing for tag authenticity.
- **Release Notes Integration:** Can associate a tag with release notes generated by the Deployment Planner.

## 3. Usage

```bash
/smartspec_release_tagger   --version v1.2.3   --commit <commit-hash>   --release-notes-path specs/my-feature/deployment/release_notes.md   --apply
```
