Create a professional, modern infographic titled 'SmartSpec Framework: 100% Workflow Loop Completeness'. The design should be clean, technical, and visually striking with a dark blue and green color scheme.

At the top center, display a large circular progress indicator showing '100%' in bold white text, with a complete green circular progress bar around it. Below it, add the subtitle '8/8 Critical Loops Complete' in smaller text.

The main content area should show 8 distinct workflow loops arranged in a grid layout (2 rows of 4). Each loop should be represented by:
1. A green checkmark icon (✓)
2. The loop name in bold
3. A brief one-line description
4. A small circular diagram showing the loop flow with arrows

The 8 loops to display:
1. Happy Path Loop - 'Ideation → Deploy → Monitor' (9 phases)
2. Debugging Loop - 'Test Failure → Fix → Verify' (5 phases)
3. Incident Response Loop - 'Alert → Triage → Resolve' (6 phases)
4. Continuous Improvement Loop - 'Metrics → Feedback → Update' (6 phases)
5. Rollback Loop - 'Failure → Decision → Execute' (5 phases)
6. Dependency Management Loop - 'Scan → Analyze → Update' (6 phases)
7. Code Quality Loop - 'Analyze → Refactor → Verify' (6 phases)
8. Performance Optimization Loop - 'Profile → Optimize → Measure' (6 phases)

At the bottom, add a footer section with three key statistics in rounded boxes:
- '40+ Workflows' 
- 'Evidence-First Development'
- 'Full SDLC Coverage'

Include the SmartSpec logo or text branding in the top left corner. Use icons, arrows, and connecting lines to show the interconnected nature of the loops. The overall style should be modern, technical, and suitable for a software development framework presentation.
